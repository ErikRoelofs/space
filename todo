backend:
v1:
V turn planets into pieces
- refactor: game has turns, turns have pieces. allows recapturing old gamestate (needed for order logging). Tile + Turn has pieces???
- turn -> tile -> piece (fix this in the generator which has it the other way around)
- eliminate board? maybe also make tiles value-objects? they don't really do anything now
- fix up construction of units
? handle transportation of cargo
- change the view to just have 1 method for all the gamedata (with player restrictions later on)
