backend:
v1:
V reduce planets to one per tile max
- update pieces to always be on a specific tile? (since there is only one planet and we don't care about which ship carries them)
- save everything after battles
V go from space -> ground (start invasions)
- think about resolutions vs loggers (should order just have a logger-id attached? or even no link at all?)
- make turn history available (logs attached to turn?)
- fix up construction of units
? handle transportation of cargo
- handle orbital bombardment
